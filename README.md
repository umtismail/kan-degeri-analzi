**Explanation:**

This code reads and analyzes data from a file called "sample.txt". 
The data includes patient age, height, weight, waist circumference, visual acuity, hearing acuity, blood pressure, blood values, cholesterol levels, smoking status, 
and various health measures.

**The code performs various data analyses, including:**

* Data exploration: Histogram plots, pie charts, and scatter plots are used to examine the distribution and summary statistics of the data.
* Frequency analysis: Tables and charts are used to calculate and visualize the frequencies of categorical variables such as age, height, weight, and waist circumference.
* Normality test: The Shapiro-Wilk test is used to test whether continuous variables are normally distributed.
* Confidence interval: 95% confidence intervals are calculated for some variables using the Wilcoxon test.
* Machine learning: A prediction model is built for systolic blood pressure using the XGBoost algorithm.
